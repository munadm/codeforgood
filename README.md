Challenge for JP Morgan's Code For Good, October 24-25 in New York City.

Our Challenge was provided to us by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The challenge consisted of connecting sponsors, who had the financial muscle to fundraisers who had the creative spark.

Our solution was to create a new social network website that allows fundraisers to post challenges that sponsors can donate to. This form of peer to peer funding is unique in the sense that it allows good ideas to scale naturally through its own viral marketing.
